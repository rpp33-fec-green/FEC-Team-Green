 ## Description
  A more detailed outline of the project. What does it do? Is there a high level list of features? If describing a project that has visual features, consider adding pictures or animations of the features and functionality in this section. See Adding Screen Captures below.

  we have created a cohesive visualy appealing, user friendly website using industry standard practices as a team. Our project includes four main areas of interest.

  - A product overview -created by Chloe Meinshausen.
  - A related projects carousel -created by Christian Ortiz.
  - A QA section created by Wen Dai
  - A Ratings and Reviews feature -created by Joann Whang

  ## Installation
   - How can another developer get your project up and running on their own? What dependencies are required? Are there environmental requirements? Be specific, and outline steps to take in order to get the project running.

  ## Usage
  - Further details on how the project is meant to be used may be helpful. For a library or framework, this section would outline how to use the library within another project (see socket.io  ). For a service that is meant to be used within a larger project architecture, instructions on how to integrate may be necessary (see node-statsD  ).
