  ## Usage
  This is our Front End Capstone project designed to demonstrate our skills and knowledge as software engineers.
  - Further details on how the project is meant to be used may be helpful. For a library or framework, this section would outline how to use the library within another project (see socket.io  ). For a service that is meant to be used within a larger project architecture, instructions on how to integrate may be necessary (see node-statsD  ).
